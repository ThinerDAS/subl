# SUBL

SUBL is one variant of [OISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_instruction_set_computer). Here, SUBL is an educational [instruction set architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture) based on the single instruction: SUBL (subtract and branch if less than).

This architecture supports a special addressing mode, which is base address + offset. As PC is itself mapped into the address space, this architecture supports [PIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code), enable [ASLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) to be implemented easily.

This fictional architecture made her first appearance in a domestic CTF AWD competition as a pwnable, namely [XNUCA](http://xnuca.erangelab.com/). Only one team seems to manage to solve the challenge in the competition in the final hours ([Aurora](https://ctftime.org/team/23890)), and the team is not [0ops](https://ctftime.org/team/4419) as we expected. `simplenote.bin` is the pwnable rom. As for the competition, the reason why we used `subl` instead of the more famous `subleq`, is that we suspected that `subleq` decompiler exists on the Internet, considering that we are not the first to [employ esolang for a pwnable](https://legitbs.net/statdump_2017/challenges/9.html).

## Pwnable nature

As in `simplenote.bin`, ASLR is enabled. Stack and code addresses are randomized (though entropy is pretty low). Also a weak flag encryption scheme is enabled, so attacker should use [Known Plaintext Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack) or reencrypt the flag with a [weak key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_key) finally.

[NX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit) is not implemented here, as enabling NX will require some more modification of compiler, namely, we need to separate `.text`+`.rodata` and `.data`+`.bss` into different regions and have some controller DMA region about page protections. [Stack canary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-Smashing_Protector#Canaries) is not implemented either, sadly.

As far as the author's knowledge, there are in total 7 vulnerabilities inside the `simplenote.bin`. The solver team probably employed around 2-3 of them.

## Usage

`subl` and `emu.py` are two implementations of this architecture.

`./subl simplenote.bin flag`

`./emu.py simplenote.bin flag`

There are certain differences between the two implementations. Also the `subl` here is a bit different from the binary in the competition. In the competition, the provided binary is unstripped and the SUBL binary is inside the ELF. Also the `subl` here fixed two bugs occurred in the binary distributed in the competition.

`subl` is merely for convenience. It is compiled within `alpine` docker statically.
